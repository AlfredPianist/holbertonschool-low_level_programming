# README

Welcome. This is the 0x03-debugging directory where I'm storing the dynamics of debugging tasks. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - holberton.h: header file for all tasks.
 - *-main.c: the diverse main files for testing the functions.
 - 2-largest_number.c: fixed the code of the function that prints the largest of three numbers.
 - 3-print_remaining_days.c: fixed the code of the function, correctly printing leap years divisible by 400 and 100.
 - 3-convert_day.c: function that converts a day of month to a day of year.
