# README

Welcome. This is the 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists directory where I'm storing more exercises showing the different actions that can be made to a singly linked list (and circular singly linked lists for the advanced tasks). Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - lists.h: Header file with the function prototypes of this project.
 - *-main.c: Main files for testing the project's functions.
 - 0-print_listint.c: Function that prints all the elements of a list of integers.
 - 1-listint_len.c: Function that returns the count of all the elements from a list of integers. 
 - 2-add_nodeint.c: Function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list of integers.
 - 3-add_nodeint_end.c: Function that adds a new node at the end of a list of integers.
 - 4-free_listint.c: Function that frees a list of integers.
 - 5-free_listint2.c: Another implementation of the free function.
 - 6-pop_listint.c: Function that deletes the first node of a list of integers and returns its value.
 - 7-get_nodeint.c: Function that retrieves a node of a list of integers given an index.
 - 8-sum_listint.c: Function that sums all the integers from a list of integers.
 - 9-insert_nodeint.c: Function that inserts a node to a list of integers given an index.
 - 10-delete_nodeint.c: Function that deletes a node of a list of integers given an index.
 - 100-reverse_listint.c: Function that reverses a list of integers.
 - 101-print_listint_safe.c: Function that prints a circular list of integers.
 - 102-free_listint_safe.c: Function that frees a node of a circular list of integers.
 - 103-find_loop.c: Function that finds the node in which the loop starts of a circular list of integers.
