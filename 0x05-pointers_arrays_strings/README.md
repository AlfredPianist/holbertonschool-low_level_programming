Welcome. This is the 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings directory where I'm storing exercises showing the usage of pointers and arrays. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - holberton.h: header file for all tasks except 11.
 - _putchar.c: Holberton's putchar version.
 - *-main.c: The diverse main files for testing the functions.
 - 0-reset_to_98.c: function that updates the value from its int parameter to 98.
 - 1-swap.c: function that swaps the value of two integers.
 - 2-strlen.c: function that returns the length of a string.
 - 3-puts.c: function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
 - 4-print_rev.c: function that prints a string in reverse.
 - 5-rev_string.c: function that returns a reversed string.
 - 6-puts2.c: function that prints every other character starting from the first one.
 - 7-puts_half.c: function that prints the last half of a string.
 - 8-print_array.c: function that prints n elements of an array in order of storage.
 - 9-strcpy.c: function that copies a string.
 - 100-atoi.c: in progress...
 - 101-keygen.c: in progress...
