Welcome. This is the 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops directory where I'm storing more exercises showing the usage of functions and nested loops. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - holberton.h: header file for tasks 0-8, 10 and 12.
 - _putchar.c: Holberton's putchar version.
 - *-main.c: The diverse main files for testing the functions.
 - 0-isupper.c: function that returns whether a given character is uppercase or not.
 - 1-isdigit.c: function that returns whether a given character is a digit or not.
 - 2-mul.c: function that returns the multiplication of two integers.
 - 3-print_numbers.c: function that prints the digits from 0 to 9 followed by a new line.
 - 4-print_most_numbers.c: function that prints the digits from 0 to 9, except 2 and 4, followed by a new line.
 - 5-more_numbers.c: function that prints the numbers 0 to 14 ten times, followed by a new line.
 - 6-print_line.c: function that prints the character "_" n number of times.
 - 7-print_diagonal.c: function that prints the character "\" in a downward diagonal of n lines.
 - 8-print_square.c: function that prints the character "#" in a square of n * n lines.
 - 9-fizz_buzz.c: function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and replaces "Fizz" for numbers multiples of 3, "Buzz" for numbers multiples of 5 and "FizzBuzz" for numbers multiples of 3 and 5.
 - 10-print_triangle.c: function that prints the character "#" in a squared triangle shape of n lines.
 - 100-prime_factor.c: in progress...
 - 101-print_number.c: in progress...
