Welcome. This is the 0x0F-function_pointers directory where I'm storing exercises showing the usage of function pointers. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - functionâ€‹_pointers.h: Header file with the function prototypes of this project.
 - *-main.c: Main files for testing the project's functions.
 - _putchar.c: Holberton's putchar version.
 - 0-print_name.c: Function that prints a name.
 - 1-array_iterator.c: Function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
 - 2-int_index.c: Function that executes a function pointer given as a condition on an if statement.
 - 3-main.c: The main file of the program.
 - 3-op_functions.c: Functions containing the diverse arithmetic operations.
 - 3-get_op_func.c: Function that returns a pointer to a function to the respective arithmetic operation stated by the given char.
 - 3-calc.h: The header file for the calculator program.
 - 100-main_opcodes.c: Program that prints the opcodes of every instruction of the main function for `n` bytes.
