 - *-main.c: The diverse main files for testing the functions.
 - 0-holberton.c: prints "Holberton" followed by a new line.
 - 1-alphabet.c: function that prints the alphabet in lowercase followed by a new line.
 - 2-print_alphabet_x10.c: function that prints the alphabet in lowercase 10 times.
 - 3-islower.c: function that checks if a given letter is lowercase.
 - 4-isalpha.c: function that checks if a given character is alphabetical.
 - 5-sign.c: function that prints the sign of a number.
