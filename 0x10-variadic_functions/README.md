# README

Welcome. This is the 0x10-variadic_functions directory where I'm storing exercises showing the usage of variadic arguments. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - variadic_functions.h: Header file with the function prototypes of this project.
 - *-main.c: Main files for testing the project's functions.
 - 0-sum_them_all.c: Function that sums all the numbers passed as arguments.
 - 1-print_numbers.c: Function that prints all the numbers passed as arguments.
 - 2-print_strings.c: Function that prints all the strings passed as arguments.
