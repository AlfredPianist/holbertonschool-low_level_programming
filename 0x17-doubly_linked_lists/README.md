# README

Welcome. This is the 0x17-doubly_linked_lists directory where I'm storing exercises showing the implementation of doubly linked lists. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - lists.h: Header file with the function prototypes of this project.
 - *-main.c: Main files for testing the project's functions.
 - 0-print_dlistint.c: Function that prints the contents of a doubly linked list.
 - 1-dlistint_len.c: Function that returns the number of elements of a doubly linked list.
 - 2-add_dnodeint.c: Function that adds a node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
 - 3-add_dnodeint_end.c: Function that adds a node at the end of a doubly linked list.
 - 4-free_dlistint.c: Function that frees a doubly linked list.
 - 5-get_dnodeint.c: Function that gets a node at a given index of a doubly linked list.
 - 6-sum_dlistint.c: Function that sums the contents of all the nodes of a doubly linked list.
 - 7-insert_dnodeint.c: Function that inserts a node at a given index of a doubly linked list. 
 - 8-delete_dnodeint.c: Function that deletes a node at a given index of a doubly linked list.
