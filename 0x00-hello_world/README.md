# README

Welcome. This is the 0x00-hello-world repository where I'm storing the basics of C. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - 0-preprocessor: runs a c file whose name is stored as a global variable and saves the output from the preprocessor as "c".
 - 1-compiler: compiles a c file whose name is stored as a global variable.
 - 2-assembler: generates the assembly code of a C file whose name is stored as a global variable.
 - 3-name: compiles and executes a c file whose name is stored as a global variable. The executable is named "cisfun".
 - 4-puts.c: a C program that prints exactly "\"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle", followed by a new line.
 - 5-printf.c: a C program that prints exactly "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,", followed by a new line.
 - 6-size.c: a C program that prints the size of various data types.
 - 100-intel: generates the assembly code with Intel syntax of a C file whose name is stored as a global variable.
 - 101-quote.c: a C program tha prints "and that piece of art is useful\" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19", followed by a new line to the standard error, returning 1.
