# README

Welcome. This is the 0x12-singly_linked_lists directory where I'm storing exercises showing the different actions that can be made to a singly linked list. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - lists.h: Header file with the function prototypes of this project.
 - *-main.c: Main files for testing the project's functions.
 - 0-print_list.c: Function that prints a singly linked list.
 - 1-list_len.c: Function that returns the number of nodes of a singly linked list.
 - 2-add_node.c: Function that adds and returns a new node to the beginning of a singly linked list.
 - 3-add_node_end.c: Function that adds and returns a new node to the end of a singly linked list.
 - 4-free_list.c: Function that frees memory of all the nodes of a singly linked list.
 - 100-first.c: Function that prints a string before the main function.
 - 101-hello_holberton.asm: Prints "Hello, Holberton" in assembly using printf.
