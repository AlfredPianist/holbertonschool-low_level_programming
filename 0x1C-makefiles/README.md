# README

Welcome. This is the 0x1C-makefiles directory where I'm storing exercises showing the usage of make and makefiles. Here are the files and its descriptions:

- 0-Makefile: Makefile with only an all rule.
- 100-Makefile: Makefile with rules all, clean, oclean, fclean and re and variables CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME, RM and CFLAGS using a .PHONY rule that ignores if a file is named as one of the rules.
- 1-Makefile: Makefile with an all rule and variables CC and SRC.
- 2-Makefile: Makefile with an all rule and variables CC, SRC, OBJ and NAME.
- 3-Makefile: Makefile with rules all, clean, oclean, fclean and re and variables CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME and RM.
- 4-Makefile: Makefile with rules all, clean, oclean, fclean and re and variables CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME, RM and CFLAGS.
- 5-island_perimeter.py, 5-main.py: Function that calculates the perimeter of an island with its main test file.
- holberton.c, main.c, m.h: Test files for the makefiles.
