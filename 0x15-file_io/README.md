# README

Welcome. This is the 0x15-file_io directory where I'm storing exercises showing the usage of I/O system calls (`open`, `read`, `write`, `close`). Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - holberton.h: Header file with the function prototypes of this project.
 - *-main.c: Main files for testing the project's functions.
 - 0-read_textfile.c: Reads a file and prints its content to the terminal given a set amount of characters.
 - 1-create_file.c:
 - 2-append_text_to_file.c:
 - 3-cp.c:
 - 100-elf_header.c:
